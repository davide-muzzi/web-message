# Web Message

This is a simple interactive web page that presents a message with two buttons: **Yes** and **No**. The "Yes" button leads to a hidden message, while the "No" button moves unpredictably around the screen when clicked.

## Features
- **Big centered text** at the top two-thirds of the page.
- **Two interactive buttons** underneath the text.
  - "Yes" button **reveals an image/GIF**.
  - "No" button **moves to different locations on click** to make it harder to press.
- **Dynamic button movement** with a mix of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal transitions.
- **Customizable colors and text** to fit different themes.
