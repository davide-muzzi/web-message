# Web Message

This is a fun, interactive web page with an engaging design! It presents a message with two buttons: **Yes** and **No**. The "Yes" button reveals a hidden surprise, while the "No" button moves unpredictably around the screen when hovered over, making it tricky to press.

## Features
- **Big, centered text** positioned in the top two-thirds of the page.
- **Two interactive buttons** below the text:
  - The "Yes" button **reveals an image or GIF** and plays background music.
  - The "No" button **moves away on hover** and, if clicked, triggers a unique video response.
- **Floating heart animations** appear when selecting "Yes."
- **Dynamic button movement** with randomized vertical, horizontal, and diagonal transitions.
- **Customizable colors, text, and media** to fit different themes.
